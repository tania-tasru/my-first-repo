# My First Python Project

This is my very first Python project where I practiced working with **lists** in Python.  
It includes operations like:

- Creating and modifying lists
- Using list methods like `append()`, `pop()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `index()`, `copy()`, `clear()`
- Finding minimum and maximum values
- Sorting and reversing a list
- Checking if elements exist in a list

## File
- `first_project.py` — Contains the full list-based practice code.

## What I Learned
- How to declare and manipulate lists
- How to use useful list functions in real code
- Basic debugging and improving my code step by step

## Output Example
